// MARK: - Stubbing Policy
/// Given Policy for treating sequence of events (products). Used to determine if stub return values should be consumed
/// once (.drop), or reused (.wrap). Applies to sequence as well - .drop means remove from stack after using, while
/// .wrap iterates over sequence indefinitely.
///
/// - `default`: Use current policy specified for Mock method type
/// - `wrap`: Default policy in general. When reaching end of sequence of events, index will rewind to beginning (looping)
/// - `drop`: With this policy, every call drops event. When events count reaches zero, given is removed from mock.
